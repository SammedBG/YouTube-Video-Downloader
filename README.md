YouTube Video Downloader with Flask and yt-dlp
This web application allows users to download YouTube videos easily. It uses a Flask backend to process requests, and yt-dlp to download videos in the best possible quality. The metadata of each downloaded video is stored in a MongoDB database. The frontend is built using React, providing a smooth user experience.

Key Features:
Easy Video Downloads: Download YouTube videos in the highest available resolution.
yt-dlp: Uses yt-dlp for fast and reliable downloads, which supports all the latest YouTube features.
MongoDB Integration: Saves video metadata (title, URL, etc.) for each downloaded video.
React Frontend: A simple and responsive interface for users to paste URLs and download videos.
Technologies Used:
Backend: Flask (Python) for handling requests and yt-dlp for downloading videos.
Frontend: React and Bootstrap for a responsive user interface.
Database: MongoDB to store metadata about downloaded videos.
How It Works:
Enter Video URL: Users paste a YouTube video URL into the frontend.
Download Video: The Flask backend uses yt-dlp to download the video from YouTube.
Store Metadata: The metadata (like title and URL) is saved in a MongoDB database.
Download Video File: Users can download the video directly from the server.
Installation Instructions:
Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-downloader.git
cd youtube-downloader
Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the backend directory (if your backend and frontend are separate):

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dependencies:

Flask: Web framework for building the API.
yt-dlp: Tool for downloading YouTube videos.
pymongo: MongoDB client for Python.
flask-cors: To handle cross-origin requests.
To install these manually, you can use:

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask yt-dlp pymongo flask-cors
Step 3: Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install the required JavaScript packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Dependencies:

react: Frontend library.
axios: HTTP client for making requests to the Flask API.
react-bootstrap: For UI components.
These can be installed by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install react axios react-bootstrap
Step 4: Run the Application
Start the Backend:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
python app.py
Start the Frontend: In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend folder and run:

npm start
The app will now be running locally at http://localhost:3000 (for the frontend) and http://localhost:5000 (for the backend).
